                <h1>Privacy Policy for Mainhouse's Sandstorm app</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>'Sandstorm' is an app run by Mainhouse, which is hosted by Amazon Web Services.</p>
                
                <h2>Data gathered from you</h2>
                <p>The app intends only to gather your personal data in ways that are clear and obvious from the user interface. If you believe that your personal data is being used in a way that you did not expect or authorize, email <a href="mailto:contact@mainhouse.com.au">contact@mainhouse.com.au</a> to report the problem.</p>
                <p>The app gathers email addresses from all users. You are required to provide a valid email address, as this is the primary mechanism by which we will notify you of issues regarding your account.</p>
                <p>The app also gathers a few pieces of personal &ldquo;profile information&rdquo; for the purpose of identifying you to other people on the app. These include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Your name.</li>
                <li>Your profile picture or avatar.</li>
                <li>Your unique user ID corresponding to the login service(s) you used to authenticate (for example, your Github username, if you log in using Github).</li>
                <li>Other personal information which you add to your profile.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All profile information is voluntary; you can edit (or remove) the information through your account settings.</p>
                <p>When you use the service to share data with other people, or when you access data shared with you by other users of the service, your profile information may be revealed to the other users with whom you are connecting, so that they can identify you.</p>
                
                <h2>Data gathered through third parties</h2>
                <p><strong>Third-party log in:</strong> If you sign in through a third-party login service like Google or Github, we collect information from it in order to populate your profile information, as described above. This information may be edited or removed through your account settings.</p>
                <h2>Data gathered automatically</h2>
                <p><strong>Logs:</strong> The service collects logs for the purpose of system health monitoring, debugging, and security. Logs may record events like &ldquo;User &lsquo;kenton&rsquo; logged in from IP address 192.168.1.10,&rdquo; &ldquo;App Etherpad version 1.5.6 was successfully installed,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Error: Database claims Etherpad is installed but I can&rsquo;t find the files on disk!&rdquo; These logs are only examined in the event that they are needed to resolve a problem (a software bug, a service outage, or a security breach), and can only be accessed by Sandstorm employees or internal fully-automated systems tasked with detecting and resolving these problems. Content of a grain (i.e. most of your data) is never intentionally stored to these logs. These logs are stored on Sandstorm&rsquo;s servers. These logs are deleted after 30 days.</p>
                <p><strong>IP Address:</strong> We may store your IP address as part of our logs. We may share your IP address to facilitate connections between yourself and other users, such as setting up a real-time video conference. We do not otherwise share your IP address with third parties.</p>

                <p><strong>Cookies and local storage:</strong> We use cookies and browser local storage for authentication and security purposes.</p>

                <h2>Data Storage Location</h2>
                <p>All data we collect is stored in Australia on servers at our infrastructure service provider, Amazon Web Services, which stores this data encrypted at rest. Amazon Web Services' <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, section 'How We Share Personal Information', states that Amazon Web Services will use data stored through the service only to deliver the service; data will not be used in conjunction with Amazon&rsquo;s other products, including advertising products.</p>
                <h2>What we do with the information we gather</h2>
                <p>We use any information we gather to improve the services we offer.</p>
                <p>We acknowledge that individuals have the right to access the personal information/data that we maintain about them. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data, should direct his or her query to <a href="mailto:contact@mainhouse.com.au">contact@mainhouse.com.au</a>. If requested to remove data, we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
                <p>We do not sell any personal data to any third party. We do not share personal data with any third party, except as necessary to implement the service. For instance, if you choose to log in through Github, then we share data with Github, but only as necessary to implement login. If you do not wish for data to be shared with a third party (other than our infrastructure provider), you may opt-out by refraining from using features that integrate with that third party &ndash; such features are clearly marked in the Sandstorm user interface. If you believe we are sharing more data than necessary, please email <a href="mailto:contact@mainhouse.com.au">contact@mainhouse.com.au</a> to report the problem so we may fix it.</p>
                <p>We also may share your data with law enforcement or other third parties to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law (including without limitation in response to service of process). Any such action will be consistent with the policies and guidelines included in our Terms of Service. We may be required to disclose an individualâ€™s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                <p>Note, however, that we expressly disclaim all liability arising out of third-party disclosures made pursuant to the preceding three paragraphs, which disclaimer you accept by your usage of the service.</p>
                <p>If we merge with another company or are acquired by another company, we will share all of the data we have gathered with that company. In this event, Mainhouse will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
                
                <h2>Correcting and deleting your data</h2>
                <p>Most things can be edited through the Mainhouse Sandstorm interface, but if not, email <a href="mailto:contact@mainhouse.com.au">contact@mainhouse.com.au</a>.</p>
                <p>Please note that even after we have changed or deleted your data from our systems, backup copies of your data may continue to exist on systems maintained by our infrastructure vendors (e.g., Amazon Web Services), over which we may not have control.</p>
                <p>Mainhouse will not edit content owned by other users (which is most of the content on the platform).</p>
                
                <h2>Effective Date</h2>
                <p>This policy is effective as of 11 April 2020.</p>


                <p>If you have any concerns or questions about how we use your data, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@mainhouse.com.au">contact@mainhouse.com.au</a></p>
